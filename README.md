# Amsnfl
This application is a versatile text converter for the Amazigh language script, designed to facilitate seamless transliteration and formatting across multiple writing systems.
Features
 * Multi-Script Conversion: Easily convert text between Tifinagh, Latin (Moroccan orthography), and Arabic Braille.
 * Advanced Orthography Tools: The app includes specific functions to handle the unique rules of different scripts usage.

# Help (App's options)
  ⵙⴼⴹ: Clear all that has been written.

 * ⵙⵙⵏⵖⵍ': Copy the result from the second text area (the conversion result).
  
 * ⵙⵙⵏⵖⵍ": Copy both texts, the input and the output. In other words, copy the original and the result.
  
 * Remove e/ⴻ: Remove the light vowel (schwa) between two different letters.
  
 * Legature ⵍ/ⵏ fix: Fix the problem of ligature change when they are next to each other (ⵍⵍ, ⵍⵏ, ⵏⵍ, ⵏⵏ).
  
 * <->x2: Double the space between Tifinagh words.
  
 * ⵉⵎⵥⵍⵉ: Write with Latin Amazigh (essentially Moroccan orthography + "e" and "-" usage), it gives you the Latin version, and adds Tifinagh to it. Just make sure to use "-" where it becomes a space in Tifinagh, but where it should be removed, you put the apostrophe marker '.
    * Example:
      {Ack-d} => {Ack-d + ⴰⵛⴽ ⴷ}
      {Dig's} => {dig-s + ⴷⵉⴳⵙ}
      
 * *i/ⵢⵉ : When you write *i where you use construct state of the plural words that start with "i" so that the it becomes "yi" in Latin but just ⵉ in Tifinagh. Check ✅ this option so that it becomes also ⵢⵉ in Tifinagh, the same happens if you write "yi" it will give ⵢⵉ. 

  # Contribute :
This application was developed using Sketchware Pro, and the source code is subject to frequent updates. For this reason, it is not currently hosted in this repository.

​I believe the core logic of the app, which focuses on the specific conversion rules between the Tifinagh, Latin, Arabic, and Braille scripts, is more valuable than the code itself. If you're interested in re-creating a better version or simply want to review the code, please feel free to reach out. I'm open to providing guidance and the source files.

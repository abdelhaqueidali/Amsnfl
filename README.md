# Amsnfl
This application is a versatile text converter for the Amazigh language script, designed to facilitate seamless transliteration and formatting across multiple writing systems.
Features
 * Multi-Script Conversion: Easily convert text between Tifinagh, Latin (Moroccan orthography), and Arabic Braille.
 * Advanced Orthography Tools: The app includes specific functions to handle the unique rules of different scripts usage.

# Help (App's options)
  ⵙⴼⴹ: Clear all that has been written.

 * ⵙⵙⵏⵖⵍ': Copy the result from the second text area (the conversion result).
  
 * ⵙⵙⵏⵖⵍ": Copy both texts, the input and the output. In other words, copy the original and the result.
  
 * Remove e/ⴻ: Remove the light vowel (schwa) between two different letters.
  
 * Legature ⵍ/ⵏ fix: Fix the problem of ligature change when they are next to each other (ⵍⵍ, ⵍⵏ, ⵏⵍ, ⵏⵏ).
  
 * <->x2: Double the space between Tifinagh words.
  
 * ⵉⵎⵥⵍⵉ: Write with Latin Amazigh (essentially Moroccan orthography + "e" and "-" usage), it gives you the Latin version, and adds Tifinagh to it. Just make sure to use "-" where it becomes a space in Tifinagh, but where it should be removed, you put the apostrophe marker '.
    * Example:
      {Ack-d} => {Ack-d + ⴰⵛⴽ ⴷ}
      {Dig's} => {dig-s + ⴷⵉⴳⵙ}
      
 * *i/ⵢⵉ : When you write *i where you use construct state of the plural words that start with "i" so that the it becomes "yi" in Latin but just ⵉ in Tifinagh. Check ✅ this option so that it becomes also ⵢⵉ in Tifinagh, the same happens if you write "yi" it will give ⵢⵉ. 

  # Contribute :
This app was built using Sketchware Pro. The source code is not included in this repository as I regularly make updates and fixes. If you're interested in reviewing the code or collaborating on a more advanced version, please contact me. The app's logic is based on understanding the conversion rules between different scripts, so recreating it from scratch is straightforward if you're familiar with the process. I may help with that.
